- **Attack Commands**: Initiate DDoS attacks with specified parameters.
- **Cooldown Management**: Prevent users from running multiple commands in quick succession.
- **Admin Commands**: Special commands for admins to manage the bot and its users.
- **Broadcast Messages**: Admins can send messages to all authorized users.
## Prerequisites
-github codespaces ( 4 core)
- Python 3.x

   ```sh
   pip install telebot
   pip install flask
   pip install aiogram
   pip install pyTelegramBotAPI
   ```
### Configuration
1. Create a bot on Telegram and obtain your bot token.
2. Replace the placeholder token in the script with your actual bot token:

# This workflow lets you generate SLSA provenance file for your project.
# The generation satisfies level 3 for the provenance requirements - see https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/requirements
# The project is an initiative of the OpenSSF (openssf.org) and is developed at
# https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator.
# The provenance file can be verified using https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier.
# For more information about SLSA and how it improves the supply-chain, visit slsa.dev.
